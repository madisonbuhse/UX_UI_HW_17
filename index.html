                <h1>SELL US YOUR LPS/CDS/BLU RAYS</h1>
                <p>Waterloo Records has been buying Vinyl, CD, DVD, Blu-Ray & Cassette collections throughout our history here in Austin. We are proud of our reputation for paying top dollar for gently used items that are in good condition.</p>
                <img class="heroImg" src="images/HeroImg.png">
                <p>Bring your CD's, DVD's & Blu-Rays or LP's to the store and we will make you an offer on what we can sell and will give back those items that we don't need. We evaluate each individual item for condition and sales history to determine your offer.
                    You can bring in items to sell anytime we're open: 10am - 9pm Daily. If you have a larger quanity, we just ask that you give us enough time to go through them before we close. We will need a valid I.D. to complete the transaction.
                    You may stay in the store or leave us a name and cell phone number and we will call you when your offer is ready. We do ask that you return to settle with us and take back any items we could not use that same day. Our space is precious!</p>
                <h1>TAKE CASH OR TRADE</h1>
                <p>You have a choice of taking cash or trade on your offer. If it is a large offer, we may need to write you a check.

                    We offer an additional 10% if you want to accept trade instead of cash, plus the tax, which is nearly 20% more on your offer!</p>
                <h1>WE MAKE OFF-SITE PURCHASES FOR LARGE COLLECTIONS</h1>
                <p class="last">Do you or someone you know have a large collection (over 1000) of vinyl records? 

                    Give us a call, as we may be able to come to you to evaluate your collection and make you an offer. We can even travel a ways if you're out of the Austin area.</p>
